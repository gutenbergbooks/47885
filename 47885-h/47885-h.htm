<h2 id="c2">THE HOODED ORIOLE.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Icterus cucullatus.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>Only a very limited portion of the
United States is beautified by the presence
of the bright colored Hooded Oriole.
The North has the richly plumaged Baltimore
oriole for a short time each year,
but only the far southeastern part of
Texas is enlivened by this graceful, active
bird of our illustration, which is &ldquo;so full
of song that the woods are filled with
music all the day.&rdquo; Both of these birds
seem hardly to belong to the North,
where somber colors seem more in harmony
with a severer climate. The Hooded
Oriole does not attempt the journey
and when we see the Baltimore,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;A winged flame that darts and burns,</p>
<p class="t0">Dazzling where&rsquo;er his bright wing turns,&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>in our northern woods we cannot but ask,
with the poet,</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">&ldquo;How falls it, Oriole, thou hast come to fly</p>
<p class="t0">In tropic splendor through our northern sky?</p>
<p class="t0">At some glad moment was it Nature&rsquo;s choice</p>
<p class="t0">To dower a scrap of sunset with a voice?&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>The Hooded Oriole has a very narrow
range, reaching from Texas southward
through eastern Mexico to Honduras,
and during our northern winters it has
the Baltimore as an associate. It is a
social bird and frequents the home of
man. One writer relating his experience
with this Oriole says: &ldquo;They were continually
appearing about the thatched roof
of our houses and the arbors adjoining
for insects; they were more familiar than
any of the other Orioles about the ranch.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It not only delights man by its song
and beautiful coloring, but its presence is
also beneficial, for it destroys countless
adult insects and their larv&aelig;.</p>
<p>The Hooded Oriole seldom builds its
nest higher than from six to twelve feet
above the ground, though in a few instances
it has been found as high as thirty
feet. Dr. James C. Merrill, in his
Notes on the Ornithology of Texas, says,
&ldquo;The nests of this bird found here are
perfectly characteristic, and cannot be
confounded with those of any allied species.
They are usually found in one of
the two following situations: The first
and most frequent is in a bunch of hanging
moss, usually at no great height from
the ground; when so placed the nests
are formed almost entirely by hollowing
out and matting the moss, with a few
filaments of a dark, hairlike moss as a
lining. The second situation is in a bush
growing to a height of about six feet, a
nearly bare stem, throwing out two or
three irregular masses of leaves at the
top. These bunches of dark green leaves
conceal the nest admirably. It is constructed
of filaments of the hair-like mass
just referred to, with a little Spanish
moss, wool, or a few feathers for the lining.
They are rather wide and shallow
for orioles&rsquo; nests, and though strong they
appear thin and delicate.&rdquo; Not infrequently
the Hooded Oriole builds its nest
in plants called the Spanish bayonet or
yucca. In such a situation the walls are
constructed almost entirely of the fibers
of the plant torn from dried leaves.
These fibers are tough and the nest walls
are much more durable than when made
with moss. Wool or vegetable down
may be used as a lining, but it is not uncommon
to find no lining. The Hooded
Oriole is not free from the intrusion of
feathered rascals. Major Bendire says
that it &ldquo;is considerably imposed upon by
both the red-eyed and the dwarf cow-birds,
and in a few instances parasitic
eggs of both species are found in the
same nest.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c4">THE CLOTHES MOTH AND ITS METHODS.</h2>
<p>Though it has incurred the bitter condemnation
of all housewives, the clothes
moth is quite an interesting little body
from the naturalist&rsquo;s point of view. The
species known in the United States bears
the long name Pellionella. Its larva constructs
a case for its occupancy. The
moths themselves are very small and well
fitted for making their way through minute
holes and chinks. The mother insect
deposits her eggs in or near such material
as will be best adapted for food for
the young. Further, she distributes
them so that there may be a plentiful
supply and enough room for each.</p>
<p>When one of the scattered family issues
from the egg its first care is to provide
itself with a home, or more correctly
speaking, a dress. Having decided
upon a proper site it cuts out a filament
of cloth and places it on a line with its
body. Another is cut and placed parallel
with the first. The two are then bound
together by a few threads of silk from
the caterpillar&rsquo;s own body. The same
process is repeated with other hairs until
the little creature has made a fabric of
some thickness. This it extends until it
is large enough to cover its whole body.
It chooses the longer threads for the outside
and finishes the inner side by a closely
woven tapestry of silk. The dress being
complete, the larva begins to feed on
the material of the cloth.</p>
<p>When it outgrows its clothes, which
happens in the course of time, it proceeds
to enlarge them. With the dexterity of a
tailor it slits the coat, or case, on the two
opposite sides, and inserts two pieces of
the requisite size. All this is managed
without the least exposure of its body.
Neither side being slit all at once. Concealed
in its movable silk lined roll it
spends the summer plying its sharp
reaping hooks amid the harvest of tapestry.</p>
<p>In the fall it ceases to eat, fixes its
habitation, and lies torpid during the winter.
With the early spring it changes to
a chrysalis within its case, and in about
twenty days thereafter it emerges as a
winged moth, which flies about in the
evening until it has found a mate and is
ready to lay eggs.</p>

<h2 id="c5">INCIDENTS ABOUT BIRDS.</h2>
<p>There is much to be learned about the
habits of birds, even in a casual observation
of them as we meet them from time
to time.</p>
<p>It is well known that the English sparrow
is not friendly toward other birds,
often driving them from their nests and
even going so far as to destroy both these
and their young.</p>
<p>Upon one occasion a sparrow took
possession of the partially completed nest
of a pair of martins, in process of construction,
beneath the eaves of a farmhouse.
When the martins returned with
their load of mud for its walls, the sparrow,
intrenched within, drove them away
with scolding cries and fluttering wings,
resisting all their attempts at dislodging
him. Time after time the attack was
renewed, all to no avail. There he was
and there he proposed to remain.</p>
<p>But the plucky martins were not so
easily vanquished. They retired for a
season, only to renew the attack with increased
vigor, waging a battle long and
fierce. Finally, however, they seemed to
understand that their enemy had the better
of them, and bent their energies toward
vengeance. Carrying mud in their
beaks, they built a wall about the sparrow
as he sat in possession of their home,
surrounding him so completely that he
was made a prisoner in the very place
where he had taken forcible possession.
And there they left him to his fate.</p>
<p>A pair of robins selected a nesting
place in the fork of a maple, standing
quite near a house, the chamber windows
of which looked down directly into it.
No sooner had they begun to carry sticks
for the foundation, than a pair of crow
black birds, with malicious intent,
pounced upon it and scattered the sticks
in every direction, taking advantage of
the absence of the owners of the nest to
carry out their mischief. Time after
time did the robins repair the damage
and begin afresh their work of construction.
No sooner were they out of sight
than the black birds tore the material out
of the tree, seemingly working in great
haste to complete their depredation before
the robins&rsquo; return.</p>
<p>Stormy encounters, amounting to
pitched battles sometimes, ensued when
the marauders were caught by the irate
home makers in the very act of tearing
to fragments the work they were toiling
so painfully to complete. Not one day
only, but several elapsed, and still the
battle continued, the interested spectators
though sympathetic were powerless
to help the rightful owners of the home.
The black birds seemingly did not want
the nest for themselves. They merely objected
to the robins building there. At
last, to the great relief of the red-breasts,
their enemies gave up the fight and allowed
them to build the nest. This they
did, laying their eggs and rearing their
young without further annoyance.</p>
<p>Many a fat angle worm does the robin
get in the spring of the year, pulling them
out of the ground where the bright eyes
spy them close to the surface, or partly
protruding therefrom. A full-grown
robin has been seen to thus capture and
swallow a round dozen of earth worms
inside of ten minutes.</p>
<p>One day a fledgling was hopping across
the lawn, the mother bird alert and
watchful, not far away. She had been
feeding it, but evidently its hunger had
not yet been appeased, for it hopped to
her side and began to make the coaxing
noise heard when in the nest as the parent
approaches with food. The mother
bird paused a moment, looked about her,
then hopping to one side a short distance,
she planted her feet squarely upon
the ground, caught one end of a worm
in her beak and commenced to pull. The
worm, which was a large one, was not
easily dislodged and tug as hard as she
could, she could not complete her capture.
Evidently the worm was too long.
She fairly tipped over backward in her
effort, yet without avail. All at once,
and as quick as a flash, so as to give it
no chance to get away, she let go her
hold and seizing the worm farther down,
drew it triumphantly forth and gave it
to her expectant offspring.</p>

<h2 id="c6">THE CHUCK-WILL&rsquo;S-WIDOW.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Antrostomus carolinensis.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>In the wooded ravines and timbered
swamps of the southern states, the
Chuck-will&rsquo;s-widow tells of its presence
by frequently calling its own
name. It, with the whip-poor-will
and the night hawk, belongs to the
family of goatsuckers and is closely
related to the swifts. The family
includes about eighty-five species of
these peculiar birds, nearly all being natives
of the tropics, though nearly every
part of the world has representatives.
The range of the Chuck-will&rsquo;s-widow is
quite limited. It includes the states from
Virginia and southern Illinois southward
to the Gulf of Mexico, and through Mexico
into Central America. It is also
found in Cuba.</p>
<p>Chuck-will&rsquo;s-widow is a bird of the
twilight and night hours. Silent during
the daylight hours, its penetrating voice,
which is remarkably strong, may be continuously
heard in the regions that it inhabits
during the evening hours and for
a time preceding the returning light of
day. It is said that on a still evening
its call may be heard for more than one
mile. In its large eyes and head, its
loose and somber colored plumage, its
quiet flight and nocturnal habits it resembles
the owls. Its short bill and the shape
of the wings, permitting rapid flight, give
it a close relationship to the swifts. Its
mouth is peculiarly fitted for the capture
of insects. The gape is enormous, and
when the mouth is fully open, will measure
nearly two inches from side to side.
It is also aided in ensnaring insects by
the long, bristle-like whiskers at the base
of the mouth. It will catch and swallow
the largest of the night-flying moths, and
though it seems almost incredible small
birds not infrequently form a part of its
diet. An observer found in the stomach
of one &ldquo;among an indistinguishable mass
of brownish matter, a small bone, about
half an inch long.&rdquo; In another stomach
he found the remains of a hummingbird
only partially digested and well enough
preserved for him to identify the species.
Dr. F. W. Langdon states that he examined
the stomach of a female Chuck-will&rsquo;s-widow
that &ldquo;contained the partially
digested body, entire, of a swamp
sparrow, intermingled with the feathers
of which were numerous remains of insects,
chiefly small beetles.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While hunting for food the Chuck-will&rsquo;s-widow
flies low, often but a few
feet above the surface of the ground. In
this habit it differs from the night-hawk,
which, like the swifts, seeks its food high
in the air. Now and then it rests, perching
on old logs or fences, from which it
will launch forth in pursuit of prey which
its keen eyes have sighted. During the
day it roosts in hollow trees or upon a
large limb in some densely shaded spot.</p>
<p>It does not attempt to build a nest.
The two dull white eggs are laid upon
the ground or upon leaves in some secluded
place in woods or thickets. It is
said that this bird, when disturbed at its
nest, will remove either its eggs or the
young, as the case may be, to a place of
safety by carrying them in its mouth.</p>
<p>Mr. Audubon relates the following incident
which came under his observation:
&ldquo;When the Chuck-will&rsquo;s-widow, either
male or female (for each sits alternately),
has discovered that the eggs have
been touched, it ruffles its feathers and
appears extremely dejected for a minute
or two, after which it emits a low, murmuring
cry, scarcely audible to me as I
lay concealed at a distance not more than
eighteen or twenty yards. At this time
I had seen the other parent reach the
spot, flying so low over the ground that
I thought its little feet must have touched
it as it skimmed along, and after a few
low notes and some gesticulations, all indicative
of great distress, take an egg in
its large mouth, the other bird doing the
same, when they would fly off together,
skimming closely over the ground, until
they disappeared among the branches and
trees.&rdquo; Because of its night-flying habit,
its somber colors and its peculiar penetrating
notes the Chuck-will&rsquo;s-widow, as
well as the whip-poor-will, was considered
by the Indians a bird of ill omen.</p>

<h2 id="c7">AN AMATEUR CIRCUS.
<br /><span class="small"><span class="sc">A True Story.</span></span></h2>
<p>We were not like ordinary children&mdash;in
fact as I look back on our younger
days it comes to me ever more strongly
how very unlike we were. There was
Harvey, my older brother, who never
did anything that other children did and
was always perpetrating some most extraordinary
thing which certainly no
one else ever would have thought of.
However, in spite of this trait, or possibly
in consequence of it, he afterwards
became famous. But that is neither here
nor there&mdash;we were all what the neighbors
termed &ldquo;unexpected,&rdquo; if they were
kindly disposed, otherwise it was some
word to the same effect though less
mild.</p>
<p>It was always a great blessing to us
and one which we received with thankful
hearts, that our father was a man of
science, and his line of work made him
the recipient of a varied assortment of
animals which he would bring home alive
and keep until he was ready to work
upon them. It was only natural that we
children should become fond of these
creatures and beg that they might be
spared the eternal sleep and left to us
to play with. This was often granted.</p>
<p>So it happened at one time that we
were the proud possessors of twenty-five
different kinds of birds, animals and reptiles
and the envy of all the children for
blocks around.</p>
<p>It is so long now since the time of
which I write that I may not be able to
recall them all, but I give them as I remember
them and by their rank&mdash;for
they had rank as well as names, the
highest in intelligence always going
first&mdash;as they did at our funerals; for
when any one of the little colony died
we would give it a burial in accordance
with its station in life.</p>
<p>First beside the grave would stand
Rex, my beautiful dog, whose knowledge
was so great it seemed almost human;
then would come &ldquo;Daisy,&rdquo; Harvey&rsquo;s
little Mexican pony; then &ldquo;Lorita,&rdquo; the
parrot, whose intelligence was really remarkable;
after her came &ldquo;Jackie,&rdquo; the
monkey, and so on down. The cat, the
crow, with his one white tail feather;
then the smaller birds; two love-birds,
a brown thrush, a blue jay and the canary.
Three baby foxes followed the
birds and then came the squirrels, gray,
red, and flying squirrels; next to these
stood the rabbits, a dozen or more of all
kinds and colors: Belgian hares, pure
yellows, angoras, whites and blacks, they
came, a motley crew. The weasel and
muskrat were next, and now the reptiles
were beginning; the turtles, a hellbender
and the snakes; black snakes, garter
snakes, green snakes, a puffing adder and
last of all came two boa constrictors.</p>
<p>I have reserved a special place for my
own dear, stupid, little hedge hog,
Billy. It used to grieve me to always
see poor Billy straggling off at the end
of the animals&mdash;ahead of the reptiles, to
be sure&mdash;a pathetic little figure of stupidity,
but Harvey insisted he deserved
no better place. Possibly it was because
he seemed so lonely and despised by the
others, but at any rate, Billy was an especial
pet of mine, and in order to disprove
Harvey&rsquo;s statement that, &ldquo;it was
impossible to teach it anything,&rdquo; I spent
much time and pains on Billy, and at
last succeeded in teaching him to utter
a little grunt when I would scratch his
back and ask, &ldquo;Want your supper, Billy?&rdquo;
But the thing that made me the proudest
was when he at last could go
up stairs. It was nearly three years before
Billy could accomplish the entire
flight, and even then it was a long and
weary pilgrimage; but the patience I
<span class="pb" id="Page_203">203</span>
had expended upon him had not been in
vain. It was comical to watch his efforts&mdash;the
little short forelegs trying to
reach up to the next stair, where he knew
a lump of sugar would be his reward.</p>
<p>But I am digressing. One day father
and mother having gone out of town to a
funeral, we children were left to ourselves.
It was an opportunity not to be
neglected, and our brains were at work
trying to plan some new game, when
Harvey arrived in our midst triumphantly
waving a huge sheet of paper&mdash;a
&ldquo;bill-poster&rdquo; he called it&mdash;upon which, in
large letters, were the headlines, &ldquo;Grand
Circus,&rdquo; and then followed an account
of the animals that would take part and
the tricks they would perform. Harvey
assigned us our posts&mdash;he himself being
ring-master, by right of his seniority and
having thought of the game. Alice was
the &ldquo;fat lady,&rdquo; while I, Paul, being the
youngest, was nothing but a &ldquo;feeder of
animals&rdquo; and tent shifter.</p>
<p>Under the direction of the Circus
Master we assembled the menagerie in
cages, or loose as the case might be, up
in Mother&rsquo;s bed-room. It took a good
deal of time to get them all together.
Polly was of a roving disposition and
had to be coaxed down from the top of
a tall tree, where she had perched, a
square or so away; the crow was up on
the roof; the rabbits and hares were
scampering all over the garden&mdash;in fact,
nothing but the caged animals seemed to
be at hand. But the task was finally accomplished
and all were ranged around
the room waiting for Harvey, who had
disappeared mysteriously some little time
before.</p>
<p>Suddenly there was a most terrific
clatter and noise, coming ever nearer
and nearer. We looked at each other
open-mouthed with surprise, when, with
a flourish of lariat and a wild Indian
war-whoop, that rose above the deafening
noise, in dashed Harvey upon
&ldquo;Daisy,&rdquo; a triumphant figure&mdash;having
accomplished the difficult feat of making
the pony carry him up stairs. He dismounted
with a jump. &ldquo;Ladies and
Gentlemen,&rdquo; he began, &ldquo;the first act on
the programme will be by this wonderful
horse&mdash;Daisy, down on your
haunches!&rdquo; The lariat swept the air in
true ring-master fashion, and Daisy obediently
sat back on her haunches.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Shake hands, Daisy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The hoof came up&mdash;but here Rex interfered.
He realized the pony had no
business there and felt the responsibility
which rested upon him. Good dog that
he was, he started toward her, barking
sharply, as though to say, &ldquo;Go away&mdash;you
know you have no business here.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then, as if his bark had been a signal,
all the other animals lifted up their
voices, and for a while it was pandemonium
let loose&mdash;screeches from Polly,
calls of &ldquo;Mamma&rdquo; from the crow
(which it could say as plainly as any
parrot, though its tongue had never been
slit), grunts and squeals mingled in utter
confusion. In the midst of it all who
should walk in but Uncle Charles.</p>
<p>Now, we all knew that Uncle was not
disposed to pass over lightly even the
least of our offenses, and what he would
say, and what was more, do now, we
dared not think. But Harvey was equal
to the occasion. He knew Uncle&rsquo;s weak
point, and went towards him nonchalantly
swinging the snakes who stuck out
their heads as they swayed back and
forth.</p>
<p>Now, to us children the snakes were
just as nice and pretty as any of the animals,
but they were quite the opposite to
Uncle Charles. The great, writhing
things, swaying to and fro as they
twisted in Harvey&rsquo;s hands and stuck out
their heads, in which the eyes dully
gleamed, filled him with loathing and disgust,
not unmixed with terror.</p>
<p>All that Uncle Charles had meant to
say vanished from his mind as he saw
Harvey advancing upon him with the
boa-constrictors, and he began to retreat
more and more rapidly, but with ever
decreasing dignity. Harvey still pursued.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why, Uncle,&rdquo; we heard him say,
&ldquo;what&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; There was no response&mdash;Uncle
Charles had gone home.
But the circus was broken up.</p>
<p>I think it is better to draw a veil over
the consequences of our circus. No circus
is complete without a side-show&mdash;and
ours was no exception. We never had
another one&mdash;at least not in mother&rsquo;s
room.</p>

<h2 id="c8">THE GRAY-CROWNED LEUCOSTICTE.
<br /><span class="small">(<i>Leucosticte tephrocotis.</i>)</span></h2>
<p>The Gray-crowned Leucosticte or Gray-crowned
Rosy Finch, as it is often called,
is a resident of the interior of British
America during the warmer months. In
the winter it passes southward, frequenting
the Rocky Mountain region of the
United States, where it is quite common
on the eastern slopes. So far as
known, within the border of the United
States, it only nests in the Sierra Nevada
in California. While on the slopes of the
mountains this Finch is usually seen in
flocks. During the most severe weather
it will frequent settled districts, becoming
quite tame, and it has been known to
seek the sheltering cover of the nests of
cliff swallows under the eaves of buildings.
When in the fields it is a restless
bird and quite shy.</p>
<p>Dr. R. W. Shufeldt, while stationed at
Fort Fetterman, Wyoming, had an excellent
opportunity to study the habits of
this handsome bird. He captured eight,
including both males and females, which
he placed in a cage especially prepared
for them. &ldquo;In a few days they not only
became accustomed to their quarters, but
apparently thoroughly satisfied and
happy. Flocks of their companions passing
over were certain to be called down,
to alight on the fences, the ground, and
in fact, everything in the neighborhood
of the cage, to even the cage itself.&rdquo; The
birds were given canary and flax seeds,
cracked wheat and finally lettuce and
other tender leaves, all of which they
seemed to relish. Dr. Shufeldt also says:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Every morning, as I approached the
cage, a general and impatient chattering
commenced for their breakfast and bath,
and they immediately availed themselves
of both in my presence. Often I deluged
the entire cage, birds and all, with a
large watering pot, and they enjoyed the
sprinkling immensely. Later in the
spring this part of the programme was
followed by their pluming themselves in
the sun, chattering among themselves
and the males giving utterance to a low,
subdued and plaintive sort of song, being
different from the shrill whistle they gave
to attract the attention of their passing
fellows outside.&rdquo; By the middle of May
all the birds of this species had left the
vicinity for their breeding grounds further
north. Dr. Shufeldt&rsquo;s captives did
not even pair and early in July he released
them. Their plumage seemed to
be at its best in the early part of May.</p>
<p>Another authority, speaking of this
bird&rsquo;s habits in the mountain regions,
says, &ldquo;During summer and autumn the
Gray-crowned Finch is common above
timber line, where it breeds, ranging
higher than the titlark and being usually
found in the vicinity of snow fields and
the frozen lakes near the summit of the
range. It is rather shy in such localities,
though exceedingly tame in winter.
Its flight is in undulating lines, like the
crossbills. The only note I have heard
it utter is a kind of churr, like the call of
the scarlet tanager. They stay above
timber-line till the close of October or
the middle of November. They are perpetually
roving from place to place feeding
upon the seeds of weeds and grasses
and are never at rest for a moment at a
time, constantly whirling about in close,

<h2 id="c9">CORUNDUM AND SPINEL.</h2>
<h3 class="generic">CORUNDUM.</h3>
<p>The mineral species Corundum affords
a number of gems known by different
names. These differences arise from the
fact that the stones were used as gems
before their mineralogical identity was
discovered. Thus red Corundum is
known as the ruby and blue Corundum
as the sapphire. When Corundum suitable
for gem purposes occurs of other
colors, such as green, yellow or violet,
the gems are sometimes known as green,
yellow or violet sapphires, respectively,
or by the name of another gem which
they closely resemble in color, with the
adjective Oriental prefixed. Such are
the gems known as Oriental topaz, Oriental
emerald, Oriental aquamarine, Oriental
hyacinth, Oriental amethyst and
Oriental chrysolite. Colorless Corundum
is known as leucosapphire.
While Corundum of all colors is used for
gems, it is only that which is transparent
which can be so employed. This is
sometimes called noble Corundum to distinguish
it from common Corundum.
The two, however, often occur together.
Common Corundum is used as an abrasive,
emery being one of its varieties,
but it has no gem value.</p>
<p>Corundum is a sesquioxide of aluminum,
with the percentages aluminum
53.2, oxygen 46.8. Its hardness is 9
in the scale of which diamond is 10, and
no other mineral except the latter equals
it in hardness. This hardness gives it
a wearing quality as a gem second only
to the diamond. The varieties of Corundum
differ slightly in hardness, sapphire
being the hardest. Noble Corundum has
a brilliant, vitreous luster, which, while
not equal to that of the diamond, is superior
to that exhibited by almost any other
gem. Corundum is a heavy mineral, its
specific gravity being four times that of
water. This high specific gravity affords
an easy means of distinguishing the gems
of Corundum from those of other species.
Corundum is infusible and is not
attacked by acids. It crystallizes in
the rhombohedral division of the hexagonal
system, certain crystal forms
being characteristic of the two varieties,
ruby and sapphire. Thus ruby tends to
crystallize in flat rhombohedral crystals,
while sapphire generally forms in
longer, hexagonal prisms. (See colored
plate in November number.)
Corundum is doubly refracting and
dichroic. Of the different colors
of Corundum above referred to, the blue
or sapphire is most common, the red or
ruby next. The other colors occur
rather sparingly, green having been almost
unknown until the discovery of the
Montana sapphires. The nature of the
coloring ingredient of the different varieties
of Corundum is not known, but there
is some reason for believing it to be chromium,
for Fremy obtained artificial red
and blue Corundum by mixing chromium
with his other ingredients, after many
attempts to obtain the desired color had
failed.</p>
<p>Red Corundum varies in hue from
rose to deep red. That of the latter
tint is the true ruby, the color known
as pigeon&rsquo;s blood being most highly
prized. Faultless stones of this color have
long been the most valuable of gems, exceeding
the diamond in price, weight for
weight, unless the latter is colored.
Rubies above three carats in weight are
about ten times more valuable than ordinary
diamonds of the corresponding
weights. But few rubies exceeding ten
carats are known. The King of Pegu is
reported to have one the size of a hen&rsquo;s
egg, but as no one has ever seen it the
story may well be doubted. In the crown
of the Empress Catherine was, however,
one the size of a pigeon&rsquo;s egg. There is
also a large uncut ruby in the British
crown, which Ruskin calls the loveliest
precious stone of which he has any
knowledge.</p>
<p>The chief home of the ruby is Burmah.
From its mines and those of Siam and
Ceylon have come practically all the
world&rsquo;s supply of rubies. The most important
Burmese mines are in Mogouk,
ninety miles north of Mandalay. The rubies
were evidently formed in limestone,
which is now much decomposed, and
seem to have been the result of metamorphism
<span class="pb" id="Page_208">208</span>
of the limestone by the entrance
of eruptive rocks. The ruby-bearing
earth is known as &ldquo;byon,&rdquo; and the stones
are obtained from it by washing. The
rubies are usually in the form of more
or less complete crystals. The mines
have been worked since the British occupation
of Burmah in 1886 by a British
company, and there can be little doubt
that a desire to acquire these mines was
the chief reason for the occupation. The
mines have not proved very profitable,
however, and only within the last year or
two has the company been able to pay
any dividends. The hope of success has
lain in the introduction of machinery for
washing the byon more cheaply than it
could be done by the primitive native
methods, and it is now believed by the
introduction of an electrical power plant
that this has been accomplished. This
company now produces at least one-half
the annual yield of rubies of the world.</p>
<p>Previous to the English working of
the mines the ruby mining was performed
by local miners under control of
the native government, all rubies above
a certain size going to the king. Whenever
a ruby of unusual size was found a
procession of grandees, with soldiers
and elephants, was sent out to meet it.
One of the titles of the King of Burmah
was Lord of the Rubies.</p>
<p>The Siamese rubies come from near
Bangkok, on the Gulf of Siam. They
occur in a clay which seems to be the
product of alteration of a besalt. These
rubies are not equal in quality to those
of Burmah. Rubies are also found in
the gem gravels of Ceylon and in Afghanistan,
thirty-two miles east of Cabul.
In our own country ruby Corundum is
occasionally found in connection with
opaque Corundum in Macon County,
North Carolina. In the gravels of Caler
Fork of Cowee Creek of this county good
rubies are found in sufficient quantity to
reward systematic mining for them.</p>
<p>These rubies are mostly small, but
some gems of three or four carats&rsquo;
weight and of excellent color have been
obtained.</p>
<p>Among the Montana sapphires an occasional
red stone is found, but they do
not have the choicest red color.</p>
<p>Another source of rubies is their artificial
production, after the method discovered
by the French chemist Fremy.
These are made by heating a mixture of
aluminum sesquioxide, carbonate of lime,
barium fluoride and potassium chromate
in a porous clay crucible to a temperature
of 1500 degrees C. and keeping the mixture
fluid for eight days. Well-formed,
clear crystals up to one-third of a carat
in weight are thus produced, which have
the hardness and color of native ruby.
They are not considered so valuable as
gems as the latter, and can be distinguished
by the air bubbles which may be
seen with a lens. The expense of making
them is nearly equal to the value
of native rubies, so that their production
is likely to be limited.</p>
<p>Rubies were known to the ancients,
being mentioned in the Bible in Proverbs
and Job. The Greeks and Romans
ascribed to the ruby the power of
giving light in the dark, and the
Hindoos describe the abodes of their
gods as thus lighted. The ruby was
much worn as an amulet, being supposed
to protect the wearer against
plague, poison and evil spirits. It
was also thought that it would turn
dark if its owner were in danger and
would not regain its color until the peril
was over.</p>
<p>The ruby is usually cut in the form of
the brilliant, like the diamond, but sometimes
the step cut is advantageously employed.
The stones from India are
usually rounded by the native gem cutters
and worn in this manner.</p>
<p>Blue precious Corundum or sapphire
is more abundant than the red or ruby.
Like the red the blue color seems to be
due to a content of chromium, since in
the artificial crystals already mentioned
as produced by Fremy, both colors occur
at times in the same crystal. The blue
color, however, unlike the reds, disappears
on heating.</p>
<p>Blue Corundum exhibits various
shades from light to dark, the color most
highly prized being that known as cornflower
blue. A good sapphire should
also have high luster and a velvety sheen.
As already noted, sapphire is somewhat
harder than ruby, and it is also somewhat
heavier. The Montana sapphires
are said to be especially hard.</p>
<p>Sapphires have at the present time not
over half the value of a ruby of the same
<span class="pb" id="Page_209">209</span>
size. A price of forty dollars per carat
is an average one for a stone of not over
ten carats and, as much larger stones are
comparatively common, the price does
not increase so rapidly as does that of
the ruby with an increase in size.</p>
<p>The world&rsquo;s supply of sapphires comes
chiefly from Siam. The most important
mines of that country are
those of Battambong, a city southeast
of Bangkok. The sapphires occur
in a sandy clay out of which
they are washed. The sapphire-bearing
region is about a hundred miles in length.
Together with the sapphires occur some
rubies, especially in the southern part of
the district. Sapphires also occur among
the rubies of Burmah, but in small numbers.
The so-called gem gravels of Ceylon
furnish many sapphires, though their
quality is not equal to those of Siam
because of paleness of color. In these
gem gravels occur also ruby, spinel, garnet,
topaz, amethyst, tourmaline and hyacinth.
Another locality for sapphires,
discovered in the early eighties, is Banskar,
in Cashmere, India. These stones
were first disclosed by the fall of an avalanche,
and later were discovered to exist
in the region in considerable numbers.
For a time they could be cheaply purchased,
but are now jealously guarded by
the government. The Montana sapphires
have been known since 1865, but
were not systematically worked until
1891. They occur in river sands east of
Helena, and were first obtained in washing
for gold. Now the mother rock has
been discovered, and this is mined, the
rock being taken out, piled in heaps and
submitted to the action of frost through
the winter. The sapphires thus become
loosened and can be readily separated.
These sapphires are well crystallized and
are of good average size, though few
gems exceed six carats in weight. Their
luster and color are for the most part
of first quality, and the stones are in demand
for the best of jewelry.</p>
<p>Noble Corundum of other colors than
those of blue and red is not of abundant
occurrence nor is it ordinarily as highly
prized as are the sapphire and ruby. Colorless
sapphire or leucosapphire is sometimes
used as a substitute for the diamond,
from which it can readily be distinguished
by its lower hardness and higher
specific gravity.</p>
<p>Certain specimens of both sapphire and
ruby, but especially the former, exhibit
when lighted a six-rayed star. This appears
as beams of light, radiating from a
center, which changes in position as the
stone is turned. Such stones are called
star or asteriated sapphires or rubies, and
are highly prized. They are usually cut
with rounded surface, as this best brings
out the figure. The cause of the star-shaped
figure is generally supposed to be
the presence of countless microscopic
cavities in the stone, which are arranged
parallel to the faces of a six-sided prism.
The total reflection of the light from
these causes the star. Others think that
multitudes of twining lamell&aelig; cause the
appearance.</p>
<p>Sapphire is a word which is the same
in nearly all languages. In Chaldean,
Hebrew, Greek and Latin it has the same
form as in modern tongues. This fact
testifies to the ancient use of the stone.
In early times sapphire was believed to
be a destroyer of poison, so that if put
into a glass with a spider or venomous
reptile it would kill it. It was regarded
also as a remedy against fevers.</p>
<h3 class="generic">SPINEL.</h3>
<p>The group of Spinel includes in mineralogy
a number of species of different
though analogous composition. The
Spinel employed as a gem is almost
wholly confined to the magnesium aluminate,
having the percentage composition
alumina 71.8 and magnesia 28.2. This is
usually of a red color, different shades
giving gems known by different names as
follows: Deep red, spinel-ruby; rose-red,
Balas ruby; yellow- or orange-red, rubicelle;
violet red, almandine ruby. Spinel
is thus known among gems chiefly as a
relative of the ruby, and this sort of
Spinel will first be considered.</p>
<p>The Spinel rubies differ from the true
or corundum rubies in hardness, specific
gravity and system of crystallization.
The hardness of Spinel is 8, or about
that of topaz, and the specific gravity
3.6. It is thus neither as hard nor as
heavy as corundum ruby. Again, the
system of crystallization differs. Spinel
crystallizes in the isometric system and
is usually found in the form, of octahedrons,
<span class="pb" id="Page_210">210</span>
while corundum ruby is hexagonal
in crystallization. (See colored plate
in November number.) Spinel is singly
refracting in polarized light and corundum
doubly refracting. Spinel ruby is
infusible before the blowpipe, but on heating
undergoes a curious series of changes
in color which are quite characteristic.
The red changes first to brown, and then
becomes black and opaque, but on cooling
the black changes to green, then becomes
nearly colorless and finally the stone resumes
its original red color. As a small
percentage of chromium is usually found
by analysis to exist in ruby Spinel, its
color is generally considered to be due to
this ingredient. While the Spinel ruby is
considered of less value than the corundum
ruby and is sometimes by fraud or
error substituted for the latter, it yet has
a definite value as a gem and is sold under
the name of Spinel ruby or some of
its varieties. This value is usually reckoned
at about half that of the corundum
ruby, although variations in quality of
the stones, as well as changes in demand,
cause differences of price. Thus Emanuel
mentions a Spinel ruby of good quality
weighing 40 carats, which in 1856 was
sold for two thousand dollars, but which
in 1862 brought at public auction only
four hundred dollars. In 1866, however,
it was again sold for twelve hundred dollars.
The Spinel ruby of the French
crown jewels, weighing 56 carats, was
in 1791 valued at ten thousand dollars.</p>
<p>Not only is Spinel ruby related to corundum
ruby in color and use, but the
two are frequently associated together
in nature. The gem gravels of Ceylon,
Siam, Australia and Brazil contain both
kinds of rubies, and the ruby mines of
Upper Burmah, where the corundum
ruby occurs in a crystalline limestone,
produce also large quantities of Spinel
rubies. Spinel rubies also come in large
quantity from Badakschan, in Afghanistan,
near the river Oxus, the name of
Balas rubies, by which they are often
known, being said to be derived from Beloochistan,
or Balakschan. The Persians
have a tradition regarding these mines
that they were disclosed by an earthquake
which rent the mountain in twain.
The localities above mentioned furnish
nearly all the Spinel rubies of commerce.
A few have been found in North America
at Hamburgh, New Jersey, and San
Luis Obispo, California. But these localities
have never afforded any appreciable
supply. No Spinel rubies of great
size are known. Bauer mentions as the
largest known, two cut stones, one of 81
carats and the other 72&frac12; carats, exhibited
at the London Exposition of 1862. The
King of Oude is said at one time to have
possessed a Spinel ruby the size of a pigeon&rsquo;s
egg.</p>
<p>Spinel occurs in many other colors besides
red, such as orange, green, blue and
indigo, as well as white and black. Occasionally
colorless Spinels occur, and as
they cannot be distinguished by their behavior
in polarized light from the diamond,
it is sometimes sought to substitute
them for the latter. They can be
detected at once, however, by their inferior
hardness. While Spinels of any
color, if transparent and free from flaws,
make desirable gems, the only colors
found in sufficient quantity outside of the
red to make an appreciable supply are
the blue and the black. The blue Spinels
resemble the sapphire in color, though
they are somewhat paler. They come
chiefly from Ceylon and Burmah, where
they occur together with the ruby Spinel.
The black Spinel is known as Ceylonite,
or pleonaste, and is also obtained chiefly
from Ceylon, although occurring of quality
suitable for cutting at Mount Vesuvius
in Italy.</p>
<p>Like the ruby, Spinel can be made artificially,
the process being to heat a
mixture of alumina and magnesia with
boracic acid, and if the red color is desired,
a little chromium oxide.</p>
<p>The Spinel ruby seems to have been
known to the ancients equally with the
corundum ruby, and the two were probably
often confounded. The natives of
India call the Spinel the pomegranate
ruby and believe to this day that it possesses
valuable medicinal properties.</p>

<p class="lr">&mdash;Frank Bolles, &ldquo;Birds in October.&rdquo;</p>
</div>
<p>Mr. Ernest E. Thompson calls the
White-crowned Sparrow an aristocrat of
the sparrow family. One of the largest
of the sparrows, its beautifully marked
plumage and its dignified mien, as it
stands on some exposed perch, immediately
attracts the attention of an observer.
Its range is extensive, covering
the whole of the United States during its
migrations, and in winter it passes further
southward into the valley regions of
Mexico. In the selection of a nesting
site a pure and cool atmosphere seems a
paramount consideration. The mountain
regions of the western United States
and the country lying north of the great
lakes and eastward into Labrador seem
to meet the requirements for the home
building of these sweet dispositioned
birds. Then its music is sweetest. During
its migration, however, localities not
favored with its home are often regaled
&ldquo;with selections of its melodies as it rests
in thickets and hedgerows while slowly
passing through our country on its northward
pilgrimage.&rdquo; From some high
bush or other favorable perch the male
will pour forth an almost unbroken song
while its mate is setting. Often this
song does not cease with the going down
of the sun, and it has been heard as late
as midnight. It is a &ldquo;lively, agreeable
song, fine and clear, and is frequently
heard from a score or more of birds at
the same time with a most pleasing effect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Its song, quite closely resembling that
of its relative the white-throated sparrow,
with which it quite frequently consorts
during its migrations, yet the two
songs are readily distinguishable. Mr.
Thompson compares the songs. He says:
&ldquo;Its usual song is like the latter half of
the white-throat&rsquo;s familiar refrain, repeated
a number of times with a peculiar,
sad cadence and a clear, soft whistle that
is characteristic of the group.&rdquo; Dr.
Coues, speaking of the two songs, says
that the song of the White-crowned
Sparrow is &ldquo;a less enterprising vocal effort,
of only five or six syllables, like
pee, dee, de, de, de, the two first long
drawn, rising, the rest hurried and lowering.&rdquo;
Transcribed into words, there
are almost as many renderings of the
White-crowned&rsquo;s song as there are observers.
Mr. Burroughs says that the
song &ldquo;begins with the words fe-u, fe-u,
fe-u, and runs off into trills and quavers
like the song sparrow&rsquo;s, only much more
touching.&rdquo; To Mr. Langille &ldquo;the song
is quite peculiar, whee-who-who-zee-zee-zee,
the first three notes in a clear whistle
and the last three in a sort of jew&rsquo;s-harp
tone, the whole being decidedly
pleasing, and not at all like that of the
white-throat.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The food of the White-crowned sparrow
consists of both insects and seeds.
To some extent they feed upon berries,
and Audubon states that in Labrador
they also eat minute shellfish, &ldquo;for which
they frequently search the margins of
ponds or the seashore.&rdquo; This bird is a
scratcher. It is also a hopper and hence
scratches with both feet at once.</p>
<p>The nest of this Sparrow is usually
constructed of grass or moss and is
placed either on the ground or in low
bushes. Audubon describes a beautiful
nest of this species which he found in
Labrador. This nest &ldquo;was placed in the
moss, near the foot of a low fir, and was
formed externally of beautiful dry green
moss, matted in bunches, like the coarse
hair of some quadruped; internally of
very fine, dry grass, arranged with great
<span class="pb" id="Page_214">214</span>
neatness, to the thickness of nearly half
an inch, with a full lining of delicate
fibrous roots of a rich transparent color.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of this beautiful Sparrow Mr. Burroughs
has said: &ldquo;Among the birds that
tarry briefly with us in the spring on their
way to Canada and beyond, there is none
that I behold with so much pleasure as
the White-crowned Sparrow. I have an
eye out for him all through April and
the first week in May. He is the rarest
and most beautiful of the sparrow kind.
He is crowned as some hero or victor
in the games. His sparrow color, of
ashen gray and brown, is very clear and
bright, and his form graceful. His whole
expression, however, culminates in a regular
manner in his crown. The various
tints of the bird are brought to a focus
here and intensified, the lighter ones becoming
white and the deeper ones mainly
black. There is the suggestion of a
crest also, from a habit this bird has of
slightly elevating this part of its plumage,
as if to make more conspicuous its
pretty markings.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c12">THE FEATHERED FISHERMAN.</h2>
<p>The cormorant is a strange and remarkable
bird, and is found in many
parts of the world. It is of large size
and somewhat resembles the goose and
the pelican. Its feet are webbed, and its
middle toe has notches like the teeth of
a saw, which help it to hold its prey. Its
plumage is generally dark, while the
feathers on its head and neck are jet
black. Its bill is long and straight, except
at the end, where the upper part
bends into a sharp hook.</p>
<p>The cormorant is a great fisher, and it
is needless to say that it is only found
where fish are to be had, as it lives chiefly
upon them. It is a very greedy bird, and
will hover over the water for hours at a
time, catching and devouring fish until
it can swallow no more. Sometimes the
cormorant will play with its prey, letting
it go and diving after it several
times, but its victim never escapes in
the end. This bird has seldom been
known to miss its aim when diving for
a fish. It drops from a great height when
descending upon its prey, and sometimes
it is seen to emerge from the water holding
a fish by the tail, in which case it
cannot very well manage to swallow it,
so the fish is tossed up into the air and,
turning a complete somersault, comes
down head foremost into the bird&rsquo;s
mouth. The home of the cormorant is
among the steep ledges of rock by the
sea, where they build their nests and rear
their young. Their nests are made of
dry sticks, weeds and moss. The old
birds return each year to their old nests,
repair them and begin rearing another
brood. At night those having no broods
roost apart, standing erect in files upon
the top of some high ledge. The young
birds are of a livid color and present a
very unattractive appearance. Their legs
and feet are enormous and all out of
proportion to their little bodies.</p>
<p>When leaving for the season cormorants
fly in long lines one after another.
In their wild state it is almost impossible
to get very near the cormorants when
they are fishing, as they are very cautious
and have many sentinels to warn them of
the approach of danger.</p>
<p>In far-off China the cormorant is
tamed and put to a very curious and
practical use. When a Chinaman goes
fishing he does not take a rod and line,
as we do, but sets out in his boat and
takes some trained cormorants along with
him. As soon as he comes to a place
where there are plenty of fish, the cormorants
plunge into the water, catching
fish after fish, and, at their master&rsquo;s call,
dropping them in the bottom of the boat.
These birds are so greedy that if left to
themselves they would eat the fish as fast
as they caught them, so the cunning
Chinaman ties a small piece of twine
around their necks so that they cannot
swallow it. In this way he gets a
boatload of fish with very little trouble.
After the cormorants have finished their
work, the strings are untied and they are
allowed to fish for themselves.</p>

<h2 id="c14">THE CARNATION.</h2>
<p>Most of the names by which we are
accustomed to designate familiar forms
of the vegetable kingdom have descended
to us from remote times and from ancient
associations. The old terms are
for the most part founded either on the
medicinal values of the plants or on some
mythological fancy that accounted for
their creation or form.</p>
<p>The Carnation derived its generic name
from the latter source. The term Dianthus
is derived from two Greek words,
signifying flower of Jupiter, while the
specific name, caryophyllus, is obtained
from words meaning nut and leaf, originally
applied to the clove tree, but later
given to the Carnation, because of its
spicy fragrance. Again, the word Carnation
is from the Latin, meaning flesh,
and was deemed appropriate because of
the pink and white color of the petals.</p>
<p>The name Dianthus, or flower of Jupiter,
originates in a Greek myth, that had
to do with the establishment of Olympus.
Jupiter had escaped the unpleasant fate
that befell his brothers, namely, of being
swallowed by their unnatural parent, Saturn.
Jupiter married Metis (Prudence),
who straightway demonstrated the fitness
of her name by bestowing on Saturn
a draught which caused him to disgorge
his domestic bill of fare, and the sons,
banding together, imprisoned their father
and his brother Titans and divided their
empire among themselves. Jupiter inherited
the heavens and became king of
gods and men. When the Thunderer
came into possession of his kingdom
Vulcan, the celestial artist, crowned him
with a chaplet of beautiful flowers, whose
white petals Iris had marked with the
colors of the rainbow, their edges being
bright with the plumage of the peacock,
which was the favorite bird of Juno, as
was Iris, her chosen attendant, after she
espoused Jupiter and became queen of
the gods. Hence the Dianthus became
the flower of Jupiter.</p>
<p>The Carnation has been under cultivation
for more than two thousand years.
Theophrastus, who gave the plant its
technical name, states that &ldquo;the Greeks
cultivated roses, gillie flowers, violets,
narcissi and iris,&rdquo; gillie flower being the
old English name for the Carnation, having
been bestowed upon it for the reason
that it bloomed in July. It was also
called the Coronarium because it was the
coronation flower of a queen of Italy during
whose reign in the sixteenth century
the plants were introduced into England.</p>
<p>From their first appearance in England
Carnations took a firm hold on the
popular fancy, varieties began to be
formed, the original flesh color being
broken up into red and white. The remarkable
susceptibility of the plants to
cultivation, their beauty and fragrance,
so appealed to the florists of Italy,
France, Germany and Holland that in
1597 Gerard wrote that &ldquo;to describe each
new variety of Carnation were to roll
Sisyphus&rsquo; stone or number the sands.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The Carnations of to-day originated
about 1840, as a distinct race. Special
attention was given in Europe to the elaboration
of the plants by M. Dalmais and
M. Schmitt, and the varieties created by
them were imported to America in 1868.
Bench cultivation was started in the
United States in 1875 and became so
popular that in 1892 the specialist or
&ldquo;Carnationalist&rdquo; first became known.
At that time there were about five hundred
distinct varieties, all of American
origin.</p>
<p>The Carnation is a native of Central
and Southern Europe. Since its introduction
into England it is said to have
escaped cultivation and to have become
fixed in several localities. In its cultivation
three general classes have been established
by English specialists. The
selfs are plants whose flowers have a
uniform color. The flakes possess a pure
ground of white or yellow, flaked or
striped with one color, the stripes running
longitudinally through the petals.
The bizarres are such as have a pure
ground, marked as in the flakes, but with
two or three colors; this form possesses
the most fragrance, especially when there
is a frequent recurrence of the stripes.
Lastly there are the picotees, having a
pure ground, each petal being bordered
with a band of color. This last form includes
many of the rarest varieties and
the yellow picotee is famous in several
royal establishments.</p>

<p class="caption">CARNATIONS.
<br />(Dianthus caryophyllus).</p></div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_219">219</div>
<p>It is a peculiar fact that rain will injure
the colors of the more delicate varieties,
and the florist must shield the
opening flowers from direct sunlight if
he would obtain the best results.</p>
<p>In the perfect flower the pod and calyx
should be long, the flower circular, not
less than three inches in diameter, rising
gradually towards the center, so as to
form a sort of crown. The outer petals
should be large and few in number, rising
slightly above the calyx and spreading
horizontally, the other petals being
regularly disposed above them, nearly
flat, diminishing in size towards the center.
The ground should be a pure color
and the petals wax-like.</p>
<p>The Carnation is allied to the pink
family, and consequently is related to the
modest Indian pink, the Chinese pink and
the Sweet William. These lowly forms
doubtless nourish a secret pride in their
relationship to the illustrious head of the
house, concerning which Shakespeare
said, &ldquo;The fairest flowers of the season
are our Carnations.&rdquo;</p>

<h2 id="c16">BUDS OF PROMISE.
<br /><span class="small">COLD WEATHER NOTES FROM NATURE.</span></h2>
<p>It has become a conventional habit
with us to look upon the winter season
as unproductive of artistic interest so
far as Nature&rsquo;s decorations are concerned.
And we note it as a period of rest from
the exhaustion of seed time and harvest.
But to the initiated and observant, it is
now that the change worketh fast, and
barely has the network of fretted
branches, looming up so purple against
an autumnal sky, become a realization,
before the winter progress of the budding
forest has changed the dreamy violet
to a rich ruddy brown, in promise of
a future fulfillment of a rich verdure of
living greens.</p>
<p>In winter, we are, as it were, behind
the scenes in the green-room of some
vast forest auditorium, and the closely
locked buds are become the dressing
rooms of thousands upon thousands of
gaily decked flower-folk, who are preparing
their multi-colored wardrobe of
gorgeous petals, with which to entrance
and delight our mortal eyes when the
golden key of the sun shall have unlocked
their doors, and are melted the
barriers of ice and snow that now reign
supreme in the great foyers of the forest.
But if at present we are barred from the
scene, the work of preparation is being
rushed forward, and on every swelling
twig there is evidence of a glorious
drama of delight which shall be uncurtained
at the clarion voice of Spring. How
many shades and colors are outlined
against the wintry sky! The bronze
points of the oaks, in contrast with the
gray of the pale ash buds, whose color
indicates the advent of some demure debutant
in Quaker costume, while the
ruddy buds of the whitewood or tulip tree,
which steal their rich color from the furrowed
red of its bark, give promise of
some gorgeous result that is later realized
in the magnolia-like bloom of rich,
creamy green, girdled with a crimson
sash, and which within the last few
years has become such a fad among
nature&rsquo;s devotees. But all of our fads are
but a continuing in the universal circle
from which, according to Lord Beaconsfield,
we never evolve beyond, and it is
written that the tulip tree was so esteemed
by the ancients that they poured
libations of wine about its roots. We
put our wine to other uses in these
twentieth century days, but we worship
at the same tree, pro tempore.</p>
<p>The highly polished buds of the June
berry or shad bush shine forth in evidence
of a future of bewildering bloom
that shall envelop its now dull branches
in a robe of fairy whiteness when &ldquo;the
shad come down.&rdquo; Break open the
tightly sealed, varnished bud of the lilac
tree, and out pours that incomparable
fragrance of Spring, an odor that challenges
all of the arts and sciences or alchemy
to produce. One of the most notable
trees in winter is the plane-tree or
buttonwood, wrongly called sycamore, a
term which can only be applied correctly
to the Ficus sycamorus, or true sycamore,
a tree closely allied to the fig, and a native
of the far East. It is the ragged appearance
of the buttonwood that makes
it so conspicuous a tree in winter, the
white trunk gleaming so distinctly
through its shattered habiliments of bark.
It is said that this disastrous state of
its covering is due to the inelasticity of
the bark, which does not expand to meet
the requirements of the tree&rsquo;s growth,
as does the bark of other trees, hence
the impoverished condition of its outer
garment. But when we see this sad
state of conditions repeated on its human
prototype, we feel that we have more
cause for sympathy than ridicule, so why
not accord the tree the same commiseration?
But I am sure there is some legendary
tale extant to the effect that in
mythological days the tree was a derelict
from duty in some line or another,
and for this was condemned to pass the
rest of its days in a tattered coat, for so
was sentenced the white Birch, who arrived
late at an important wedding of
the gods, hence doomed to wear her wedding
garment of snowy bark throughout
all ages in penance for her dilatoriness.
<span class="pb" id="Page_221">221</span>
But if the buttonwood wears the
coat of poverty, it is more than abundantly
supplied with buttons, which are
so tightly sewed on that it is no easy
task to secure a bunch of these drooping
balls for decorative purposes, and
for which they are so effective when hung
among clusters of the scarlet berries of
the bitter-sweet. Their secure hold on
the parent stem has thus aroused the interest
of John Burroughs:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why has Nature taken such particular
pains to keep these balls hanging to
the parent tree intact till spring? What
secret of hers has she buttoned in so
securely? for these buttons will not come
off. The wind can not twist them off,
nor warm nor wet hasten or retard
them. The stem, or penduncle, by
which the ball is held in the fall and
winter, breaks up into a dozen or more
threads or strands, that are stronger
than those of hemp. When twisted tightly
they make a little cord that I find it
impossible to break with my hands. Had
they been longer the Indian would surely
have used them to make his bow strings
and all other strings he required. One
could hang himself with a small cord of
them. Nature has determined that these
buttons should stay on. In order that
the needs of this tree may germinate, it
is probably necessary that they be kept
dry during the winter, and reach the
ground after the season of warmth and
moisture is fully established. In May,
just as the leaves and the new balls are
emerging, at the touch of a warm, moist
south wind, these spherical packages suddenly
go to pieces&mdash;explode, in fact, like
tiny bombshells that were fused to carry
to this point&mdash;and scatter their seeds
to the four winds. They yield at the
same time a fine pollen-like dust that one
would suspect played some part in fertilizing
the new balls, did not botany teach
him otherwise. At any rate, it is the
only deciduous tree I know of that does
not let go the old seed till the new is well
on the way.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Next to the cedar tree, this tree is the
strongest power in mythology and was, by
the ancients, consecrated to Genius, and
who knows what mighty stores of intelligence
is buttoned under its tattered
coat? and I myself can bear witness to
its strong will and determination under
adverse circumstances, for a huge tree
that has fallen from a high bank into the
river below, has floated down stream to
a lodgment, and there put forth a vigorous
growth of foliage, and is thriving
well under these abnormal conditions.
The maple bloom is now closely housed,
with but little show of promise, but if
one were favored with a specially alert
ear, I am sure that he could hear the rush
of the ascending sap blood, hurrying upward
in answer to the call of the quickening
Spirit of Spring. In many of the
creepers, the lilies and the gourd, a kind
of fever heat is perceptible at the time
of inflorescence, and the heat has been
observed to increase daily from sixty to
one hundred and ten or even one hundred
and twenty degrees, and without doubt
the forest temperament rises accordingly.</p>
<p>As yet the birds have not taken all of
the scarlet berries of the bitter-sweet
vine, which clings lovingly, but with a
somewhat parasitical clasp about the hospitable
boles of the great trees. In color
rivalry looms up the dark red panicles
of the sumach, whose acrid fruit, which
is a last resort for hungry birds, must
prove a pungent pill to the feathered
folk. But it is a line of beauty across
the hillside:</p>
<div class="verse">
<p class="t0">Like glowing lava streams the sumach crawls</p>
<p class="t0">Upon the mountain&rsquo;s granite walls.</p>
</div>
<p>Peeping out from the sheltered crannies
are numerous long, slender fronds
of the Christmas fern, Polystichum
acrostichoides, gleaming like emerald
bars against the white of the snow bank.
Outlining against the sky are the aristocratic
hemlocks which belong to the regal
pine family, and which have established
a social precedence by wearing their
holiday clothes all the year round, in opposition
to their more humble, deciduous
kin, who are now in working habiliments,
and they flaunt their heads haughtily, but
their thickly clothed branches form a
warm shelter for snow bound birds, so
that their distinction is not without its
advantages. In a sheltered nook still
flourish a few plants of &ldquo;Life Everlastin&rsquo;,&rdquo;
so dear to the hearts of Mary
Wilkin&rsquo;s quaint New England characters
as an allayer of rheumatic ills, and it
still exhales its aromatic fragrance in the
air. Here and there a witch-hazel waves
its scraggy branches, still laden with
<span class="pb" id="Page_222">222</span>
their velvety seed capsules, which have
but now bursted open and shot forth their
glistening seeds, and whose inconsequent
yellow bloom has only just shed its slender
petals to the winds. A few lingering
wild rose haws are withering upon the
parent stem, yet glowing like cherries
against the wintry sky, but break off a
tiny branch and a whiff of Richard Jefferies&rsquo;
&ldquo;sweet briar wind&rdquo; is wafted
across one&rsquo;s nostrils, filling one&rsquo;s brain
with visions of the gladdening spring
time. A gaily plumaged jay dashes his
brilliant blue through the branches of a
thickly needled pine, and a scarlet
crowned &ldquo;downie&rdquo; taps diligently up and
around the worm-infested trunk of an
old apple tree, in search of an unwary
morsel, and one comes to the conclusion
that after all, winter is not all gloom and
grayness, but filled with bits of glowing
color and vitality, if only one&rsquo;s eye is
set for its beauty, instead of its bleakness.</p>

<h2 id="c17">HOW A CAT SAVED THE LIFE OF A CANARY.</h2>
<p>In a small town in Minnesota, noted
for its several state institutions of learning,
lives a widow whose success in the
training of a cat has made her quite
noted in her locality.</p>
<p>Tiger, the cat, is not famous for his
long hair nor for his long pedigree. He
is simply a creature who has been loved
and petted into a wonderful amount of
sympathy for his mistress and he seems
to know instinctively many of her likes
and dislikes, and he would no more
harm Dick, the canary, who lives in the
same room, than he would attack the
hand which places the saucer of milk
before him each day.</p>
<p>One morning, Mrs. Rogers (as we
will call his mistress, though that is not
her true name), allowed Dick to take his
bath in his tiny tub upon the dining-room
floor, while she rearranged and
dusted the furniture of the room, leaving
the door wide open during the time.
A neighbor sat by the doorway watching
Dick bathe and, not having the faith in
Tiger which his mistress held, exclaimed,
&ldquo;That cat of yours will kill your
bird sometime. I know he will.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Mrs. Rogers smiled very quietly as
she stopped to give Tiger an assuring
pat on the head and a word of praise for
his good behavior, for she believed he
understood the neighbor&rsquo;s unkind remark.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tiger is a good cat and I&rsquo;ll trust him
any time with Dick,&rdquo; said his mistress,
turning away from him to attend to her
duties.</p>
<p>A prolonged &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; like a stifled
scream came from the neighbor&rsquo;s lips
the next minute for Tiger had sprung at
Dick and held him tightly in his cruel
jaws.</p>
<p>&ldquo;See Tige! See Tige!&rdquo; exclaimed the
visitor.</p>
<p>But Dick never fluttered a bit and
Mrs. Rogers patted Tiger again as she
caught sight of a vanishing stranger cat
disappearing through an open window.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Brave old Tiger! Good little Dickie!&rdquo;
said their mistress, as she took the bird,
unharmed, from Tiger&rsquo;s teeth, which had
held the bird safely away from real danger.</p>
<p>Dick flew back to his open cage, Tiger
went back to his nap in the sunshine,
and the lady visitor learned the lesson
that love works wonders in even the
creatures that do not speak as we do.</p>

<h2 id="c18">THE POCKET RATS.</h2>
<p>Rats and mice seem to enjoy living in
localities that are frequented by but few
other animals. They are also adepts at
seeking food supplies and travel long distances
when hunger demands and a supply
of food is not at hand. The Pocket
Rats are no exception to this rule and
some of the species live in dry, arid regions
where but little vegetation grows,
aside from a few species of cactus. The
rat of our illustration was found by Mr.
Frank M. Woodruff in such a locality,
where it had hidden under the sheltering
branches of a cactus.</p>
<p>The marked characteristic that gives
these little animals their name is the
pockets or cheek pouches. These are
external openings outside of the mouth
and are lined with a furry skin. They
are ample in size and the two will hold,
in some instances, a heaping tablespoonful
of grain. &ldquo;The filling is done so rapidly
that, where a hard grain like wheat
is used, a continuous rattling sound is
made. The ejecting of the grain from
the pockets is aided by a forward, squeezing
motion of the fore feet, each foot
making two or three quick forward passes.
Some of the species seem to thrive in
captivity, and after a few days do not
fill their pouches, apparently having
learned that it is a useless labor. When
obtainable, their natural food consists
of various plant seeds, but when in the
neighborhood of cultivated fields and the
vicinity of houses, they feed also upon
grain and the vegetable waste from
camps and houses. Mr. F. Stephens says
that some of the species, whose habits he
has studied, will eat about a heaping
tablespoonful each of wheat or barley
in twenty-four hours and one or two
square inches of beet or cabbage leaves.&rdquo;
As they are often found in regions practically
devoid of water, a large part of
the year, it is highly probable that they
obtain the necessary moisture from succulent
leaves. In captivity they drink but
little water. Mr. Stephens writes of one
that he trapped that was evidently very
hungry. Placing it in a cage he gave it
grain. He says: &ldquo;It was amusing to see
the eagerness with which it immediately
went to filling its pockets. It stuffed
them so full that it must have been positively
painful, and then it would not stop
to eat, but hunted about for some exit;
not finding one, it ejected the contents of
its pockets in a corner out of the firelight
and went back for more. This time
it ate a little, but soon gathered the remainder
and deposited it with the first.
After eating a little more, it refilled its
pockets and hunted about for a better
place to make a cache, seeming to think
its first choice insecure. These actions
plainly show that they are in the habit
of storing away their supplies.&rdquo; In some
fields where they are common it is said
that more than a pint of grain is
ploughed up in a single cache.</p>
<p>The elongated hind legs, well pictured
in our illustration, give these rats a wonderful
power of locomotion. As they
leap rather than run, they are often called
Kangaroo Rats. Mr. Woodruff states
that the specimen, which we have used,
when trying to escape started with short
leaps, but as it gained headway the spans
were about four feet in length and at
the highest point about eighteen inches
from the ground. He found them quite
common in the vicinity of San Diego,
California. They are nocturnal in their
habits, seeking their food through the
twilight and night hours, and resting
during the day in their burrows or in
shaded places near the openings to them.</p>
<p>When resting the position of the feet
and the arched back give them the appearance
of a hairy ball. The tail is laid
straight out from the body, if space will
permit, or when the quarters are
cramped it may be curled alongside the
body. The tail is quite useful, as it is
used as a sort of brace when the animal
raises on its hind feet to view its surroundings.</p>
<p>There are a number of species of these
interesting rats. The first one was discovered
and named in 1839. The species
we illustrate was first found near San
Diego and named Dipodomys similis in
1893.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_226">226</div>
<h2 id="c19">WINTER VISITORS.</h2>
<p>For several years I have been interested
in birds. I have watched them
through the glad nesting time of spring,
have sought their quiet retreats in summer
and have heard their faraway calls
as they moved southward in the dark,
cold, misty evenings of autumn; but for
the first time I have succeeded in bringing
them near enough to study them in
winter.</p>
<p>On the ledge of a second story window,
out of the reach of cats, a wide shelf is
fastened, and above it the branch of a
dead cherry tree is securely wired to a
shutter. On the shelf I scatter scraps
from the table and shelled corn. To the
branch, a long piece of suet is always
bound with a cord. This is my free lunch
table, spread for all my bird friends who
wish to come. They have accepted the
invitation beyond my expectation, and
have fully repaid me for all the trouble
it has been to prepare for them, in the
pleasure their company gives me. I sit
just inside the window and they appear
not to notice me, so that I have an excellent
opportunity to note their peculiarities.</p>
<p>The one that comes every day and all
day, is the tufted titmouse. He comes
down with a whir, looks sharply about
with his bright, black eyes, then takes
a taste of the suet or marrow, and sometimes
carries a crumb away. It is hard
to tell how many of them come, as they
all look so much alike. Not more than
two or three ever come at once.</p>
<p>A pair of downy woodpeckers are constant
visitors at the meat table. They
seldom come together, but sometimes it
is the male with his bright red head spot,
sometimes the female, in her plain black
and white stripe. She is very plain, indeed,
and somewhat more shy than her
mate. If an English sparrow comes to
the shelf while either of them is on the
branch, it quickly drops down beside him
as if to say, &ldquo;See here, you are out of
place,&rdquo; and the sparrow leaves without a
taste of the good things.</p>
<p>Occasionally a winter wren, with his
comical tail and delicate manners, calls
on his way somewhere, and makes a
pleasing variety in the appearance of the
visitors. He eats all he needs of the
bread crumbs before leaving, unless some
sudden movement within startles him.</p>
<p>The blue jays are the most persistent
and least welcome of all. Their plumage
is beautiful, viewed at such close range,
but their actions are not pleasing. They
flop down near the window and look in,
turning the head from side to side, as if
suspecting some enemy there. The slightest
sound sends them back to the trees,
but they soon return, and eat as if they
were starved, driving their bills into
the meat with quick hard strokes, or
grabbing at the corn in a nervous, famishing
way. After eating a few grains, they
fill their mouths and carry it away to hide
for future emergencies. I have seen
them hide it in an old gatepost or drive
it down in the crevices of trees. They
carry away more than they eat and probably
never find half of it again, for they
have no special hiding place, but they
tuck it in wherever they see a convenient
place. It is somewhat provoking to
have the table cleared in this way, unless
it is always watched, for the corn is
spread especially for the cardinals whose
brilliant color is such a delight to the
eye amid the sombre colors of winter.
There is one blue jay with a drooping
wing. We call him our &ldquo;Bird with the
broken pinion.&rdquo; He appears to have no
difficulty in getting to the table, and his
appetite is not impaired, but possibly,
as Butterworth says, &ldquo;He will never soar
so high again.&rdquo;</p>
<p>A pair of cardinals come and partake
of the corn with a grace and dignity befitting
their royal apparel. They do not
hurry nor worry, but eat slowly and stay
until they have enough. They are very
quiet now, but their spring song will
repay me for all the corn they will eat.</p>
<p>But of all that come, none are more
interesting than the chickadee. He surely
merits all the bright sweet things that
have been said or written about him. He
is the only one that utters a note of
thanksgiving for his daily bread before
he begins to eat. Then he has such gentle,
confiding ways. Today the ground is covered
<span class="pb" id="Page_227">227</span>
with a deep, sleet-encrusted snow;
the trees are all icebound, and it must be
one of the most disheartening days the
bird world ever knows, yet just now, at
four o&rsquo;clock, two chickadees are singing
their good night song outside my window.
In a few minutes they will be
snugly tucked away in some wayside inn,
some sheltered nook prepared by Mother
Nature, where they will sleep away one
more cold night, to awaken one day
nearer the joyous springtime.</p>

<h2 id="c20">BEAUTIFUL VINES TO BE FOUND IN OUR WILD WOODS
<br /><span class="small">III.</span></h2>
<p>Another beautiful vine that grows wild
in most of our states is the Trumpet
Flower, a popular name for various species
of Bignonia and Tecoma, which belong
to the other Bignoniaace&aelig; or Bignonia
family, all of which are either
shrubs or woody vines. There are two
or three species of this family native to
the United States, chief among them being
the Tecoma radicans, or what is generally
known as the Trumpet Flower.
In some parts of the country it is also
called Trumpet Creeper.</p>
<p>The word Tecoma is of Mexican origin
and means trumpet, the only known
difference between the Tecoma radicans
and the Bignonia is a structural difference
in their pods.</p>
<p>We have several imported varieties of
both, that come from South Africa and
Japan, but none prettier than the Tecoma
radicans or Trumpet Flower, which any
of us can find along almost any roadside
or in rich, moist woods, blooming in the
greatest profusion in August and September.</p>
<p>It is a woody vine, climbing to great
heights by abundant rootlets, produced
along the stems. Its pinnate leaves have
from five to eleven ovate, toothed pointed
leaflets. Its deep orange-red flowers
come in midsummer and later and grow
in corymbs or clusters; its tubular corolla
is funnel-shaped, two or three inches
long, with five somewhat irregular lobes,
within which the four stamens are enclosed;
its fruit is a two-celled pod, containing
numerous winged seed.</p>
<p>The Trumpet Flower is found in a
wild state from Pennsylvania to Illinois,
and southward, and is very common in
cultivation, being vigorous and perfectly
hardy, soon covering a large space and
reaching to a height of sixty feet. Blooming
as it does in late summer, and early
fall when flowers are scarce, the abundance
of its great orange and scarlet flowers
make a very showy spot in a dull
landscape, and an especially attractive
bit of color, if you happen to find a vine
around which the ruby-throated hummingbirds
are hovering, they being very
partial to the nectar from its flowers.</p>
<p>It is a beautiful vine to drape a tree
that is in itself not very pleasing, or to
cover brick or stone outbuildings.</p>
<p>Its faults, and it is a shame to discover
faults in anything so beautiful, are a
tendency to become naked below, which
can be remedied by cutting back, an over
abundant production of suckers, and its
immensely long roots.</p>
<p>Bignonia capreolata, named for the
Abbe Bignon, who first found it, is a
closely related species, of a more southern
range than the Tecoma, being found in
Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia. Its
leaves consist of but two leaflets and a
terminal tendril. Its flowers, similar to
those of the preceding, are orange. In
the southern states it is called cross-vine,
as the wood if cut transversely shows a
cross.</p>
<p>One species of the Trumpet Flower,
the Tecoma stans, is a non-climbing
shrub of southern Florida and northern
Mexico. It grows about four feet high
and bears large clusters of lemon-yellow
flowers. It is hardy at Washington in
the Botanical Gardens and there were
fine plants exhibited at the Buffalo Exposition.</p>

<p class="t0">Have you ever,</p>
<p class="t0">On your travels</p>
<p class="t">Through the queer, uncertain South,</p>
<p class="t0">Had a &rsquo;simmon&mdash;</p>
<p class="t0">Green Persimmon&mdash;</p>
<p class="t">Make a sortie on your mouth?</p>
<p class="lr">&mdash;Frank H. Sweet.</p>
</div>
<p>The Persimmon, or Virginian Date
Plum, is a North American tree, growing
wild in nearly all of the Southern
United States, and will thrive and ripen
its fruits as far north as the state of Connecticut
and the great lakes. It is one of
about one hundred and eighty species belonging
to the genus Diospyros. These
are all hardy trees or shrubs. Representatives
of the genus are found in nearly
all regions that have a tropical or a temperate
climate. The name Diospyros is
of interest, for it is from a Greek name
used by Theophrastus, and is derived
from two words, one meaning Jove&rsquo;s and
the other wheat or grain. This name of
Theophrastus has reference to the edible
fruit and literally translated means divine
or celestial food.</p>
<p>Only a few of the species are cultivated.
These are highly ornamental
trees with a beautiful foliage, which is
rarely attacked by insects. The common
Persimmon of America is the only
species that is at all hardy in the north.
This and the Japanese species (Diospyros
kaki) are the only trees that produce
the edible fruit commonly found in the
market. The wood of nearly all the species
of Diospyros is hard and close-grained.
The trees that yield the beautiful
ebony of commerce belong to this
genus, and the species that is said to
yield the best quality of this wood (Diospyros
ebenum) is a native of the East
Indies and Ceylon. It is also cultivated
to some extent in hothouses and in tropical
climates.</p>
<p>The common Persimmon of the United
States (Diospyros virginiana) is a tree,
usually growing to a height of about
fifty or sixty feet, and rarely reaching
one hundred feet. This is a beautiful
round-topped tree with more or less
spreading branches. The name Persimmon
is of Indian origin and of unknown
meaning. The fruit of this species is
but lightly appreciated except by those
who visit the forest regions in which it
is native, for it is only cultivated to a
very limited extent. The fruit is globular
in form and quite plum-like. It varies
both in size, color and flavor. When
green the fruit is astringent and has a
very disagreeable taste. This, however,
disappears when the fruit becomes fully
matured.</p>
<p>It is generally thought that the fruit
of the Persimmon is not palatable until
there has been a frost. Regarding this
supposition Dr. L. H. Bailey says: &ldquo;The
old notion of early botanists that this
fruit must be subjected to the action of
frost before it becomes edible is erroneous.
Many of the very best varieties
ripen long before the appearance of frost,
while others never become edible, being
so exceedingly astringent that neither sun
nor frost has any appreciable effect on
them.&rdquo; This fruit, so popular in the localities
where it grows, was not unknown
to the natives who traversed the wild
woods before the time of the early explorations
and conquests of America. A
narrative of De Soto&rsquo;s travels relates that
his men, who were camping at a native
town &ldquo;halfe a league from Rio Grande&rdquo;
(Mississippi River) found the river &ldquo;almost
halfe a league broad and of great
depth,&rdquo; and that the natives brought to
them &ldquo;loaves made of the substance of
prunes, like unto brickes.&rdquo; These loaves
were made of dried Persimmons, possibly,
mixed with some pulverized grain.
At the present time, in some southern localities,
the fruit is not infrequently
kneaded with bran or ground cereals,
molded and baked.</p>

<h2 id="c22">AS TO ALLIGATORS.</h2>
<p>The alligator generally impresses the
mind as a reptile so dangerous that he
should be given a wide berth on any and
all occasions, yet it is really peaceable and
harmless unless aroused to the defensive.</p>
<p>Anywhere south of the Mason and
Dixon line, among the rivers, lakes and
marshes, are found the alligators, but
Florida, because of its great area of such
places which the alligator delights in,
may almost be termed the home of the
alligator.</p>
<p>In traveling through the dense hammocks,
where for miles and miles the sun
scarcely penetrates through the heavy
timber and the rank vegetation beneath,
one may often meet with the huge saurian
as he travels from one cave or mud
hole to another. Tease or wound him,
and he will show fight, and woe to him
who then comes within reach of his
vengeance. And it matters little to him
with which end he must fight. He can
crush equally well with his tail as with
his jaws&mdash;or, to end the matter more
speedily, he may use both. But if you
go on about your business his &rsquo;gator-ship
will do the same, and not notice
you so much as ever to wink. Come upon
him as he is lying asleep or sunning himself
on a mud bank, if he is aroused and
finds you between himself and the river
he will sweep you aside as you yourself
would a fly from the sugar bowl, and
then slide into his native element, and
he does this so quickly as to allow you
little time to explain that you just happened
there and had no designs on him
whatever.</p>
<p>At other times you might think you are
stepping out onto a sunken log imbedded
in the mud, but find that the log suddenly
gets very much alive, for under
that slimy mud and grass an alligator
was taking a sitz bath. You might have
walked all around him with impunity,
but walking on him is an indignity he
resents quickly&mdash;so quickly that it is a
question whether you get back to safety
or are served up for the alligator&rsquo;s dinner.
Sometimes you may see an alligator
lying motionless just under the surface
of the water, with his long snout protruding.
His jaws are open far enough to
allow the flow of the current through
them, and when a stray fish or other
tid-bit comes along with that flow, the
jaws snap down on it. He can be seen
keeping his trap thus set for hours at a
time. Should you row near in order to
watch him, he will not seem to pay the
least attention to you if you behave yourself;
but if you drop an oar or shout at
him he will drop down out of sight and
lie low waiting to see what you are really
up to. Now, if you will remain perfectly
quiet as to motion, but will imitate the
barking of a puppy, the squealing of a
pig, or the caw of a crow, although there
was not an alligator in sight, you will
soon see several snouts appear, and gradually,
if you keep up the call, the alligators
will come near and nearer, in
curiosity as to what the call means. A
half dozen or more will be nosing about
the boat, and you have a good chance to
observe them closely&mdash;if your nerves can
stand it. This sport is exceedingly dangerous,
for if the boat should bump an
alligator on the nose, straightway all
would make common cause and reduce
the offending boat into splinters; and that
the occupant of the boat should escape
would be next to impossible.</p>
<p>When the female alligator wishes to
build her nest, she selects a dry place,
open to the rays of the sun, yet near to
water. She commences her nest by scraping
together a lot of dry leaves, grass or
other trash, until she has a round, compact
bed as large as a cartwheel. On this
she deposits her eggs. This done, she
proceeds to cover them up by going
round and round the nest and, with her
body pushing more leaves and trash over
the eggs. A well made nest is of the
shape of a hay-cock, and very nearly so
large. The nest completed, the alligator
goes off to the nearby water, and leaves
the sun to do the hatching. Many differ
<span class="pb" id="Page_232">232</span>
as to the time it takes for the eggs to
hatch, as much depends on the construction
of the nest, and also on the heat of
the sun. So, also, many differ as to
the number of eggs a female will lay in
one season. Some aver that eighty is
the average number, but the writer has
never found more than forty in one nest.</p>
<p>Alligator eggs are white, oblong in
shape, about three inches and a half in
length, and have a ring around the middle.
When first hatched the little fellows
are red and black spotted and
striped. They are exceedingly lively,
and, as soon as hatched, make straight
for the water&mdash;apparently in search of
the protecting care of their mammy&mdash;but
they often come back to sun themselves
about the old nest.</p>
<p>The male alligator is a cannibal, and
will eat his own young if he finds them.
For this reason the female selects a
place far from the usual haunts of her
spouse when she prepares for maternal
cares by building her nest. And she
stays with her babies until she thinks
they are capable of wiggling away from
dangers themselves.</p>
<p>When in Florida many of the winter
tourists secure these little alligators and
take them North to keep them as pets.
As they are exceedingly slow in growing,
they make &ldquo;little&rdquo; and &ldquo;cunning&rdquo; pets for
many years. When they get to be &ldquo;big
fellows,&rdquo; they had best be dispensed with.</p>
<p>Although the alligator has long been
considered one of the despised species
of animals, or reptiles, it is far from
being a useless one&mdash;though its use is
only practical after it has been killed.
One may say that there is no good alligator
but a dead one, but one may qualify
the remark by adding that the dead one
is very good, indeed, for commercial purposes.</p>
<p>There is a great demand for alligator
hides, and good prices are being paid
for them. Consequently the hunting of
alligators for the sake of their hides, and
the preparing of them for shipment is a
profitable industry. Then the tanning of
these hides and, finally, the making of the
leather into trunks, valises, purses, etc.,
makes three distinct industries due to the
alligators.</p>
<p>Those making a business of hunting
alligators generally take the night time
for it, and the darker the night, the better.</p>
<p>Two men, provided with a light, easy-going
skiff, a good rifle, an ax, and a
bull&rsquo;s eye lantern fastened to the forehead
of one of the hunters, start out together.
One man&mdash;the one with the lantern&mdash;sits
in the bow of the boat; it is
his business to &ldquo;shine the eyes&rdquo; of any alligator
who might come within the radius
of the light. The eyes of the game will
shine like two balls of fire, and if the
man is careful to make no unnecessary
movements, and his partner is careful
to scull the boat steadily and silently, they
can get so near the game as to almost
touch it.</p>
<p>The man in the bow holds, from the
very start, the rifle ready for a quick shot.
This shot comes so suddenly and so unexpectedly
to the alligator, that, quick
as he generally is, he falls a prey to his
prolonged curiosity as to the nature of
that approaching light.</p>
<p>The hunters must be so expert at their
trade that as soon as the shot has been
fired the man who did the shooting must
lean over and grasp the alligator by the
tail, pull him half way over the gunnel
of the boat and hold him there for the
quick cut with the ax in the back, which
his partner must be, by this time, prepared
to strike. All this is done far
quicker than it can be told; so quickly
is it done that often the alligator is
killed by the ax only, and it is found that
the bullet had never struck him, and he
had only been either stunned, or so demoralized
as to forget his own power.</p>
<p>This cut in the back, severing the vertebrae,
places the alligator entirely hors
de combat. There is even no flopping
about in the bottom of the boat where he
is then thrown. Now the hunters are
ready to proceed on to their next capture.</p>
<p>The morning generally finds the hunters
with their boat loaded, and they are
glad of a short rest and&mdash;breakfast.
There then remains but the task of skinning
their game and salting the hides
down in barrels, ready for shipment.</p>

<br /><span class="small">(<i>Taraxacum taraxacum</i> Karst.)</span></h2>
<blockquote>
<p>You are bilious, my good man. Go and pay a guinea to one of the doctors in those
houses.... He will prescribe taraxacum for you, or pil. hydrarg.&mdash;Thackeray, Philip, ii.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dandelion is a perennial herb thoroughly
familiar to everyone, as it is
found almost everywhere throughout all
temperate and north temperate countries.
It has a basal tuft of rather large, spatulate
to lanceolate, deeply incised leaves.
There are several slender, cylindrical, hollow
stalks, six to twelve inches long,
each one ending in a bright yellow flower
head with numerous small flowers. The
fully matured fruits form a white, fluffy
head and are easily removed and scattered
by air currents. Each fruit is a
miniature parachute and every child has
blown upon the fruit head and watched
the individual fruits sail for great distances,
suspended in air by the parachute-like
expansion of the pappus. Roots are
quite large, branching, rather fleshy. The
plant contains a milky juice, having a
bitter taste.</p>
<p>The Dandelion is said to be a native
of Greece, southern Europe and Asia
Minor. It has spread very rapidly and
widely via the commercial routes. It has
become thoroughly naturalized in the
United States and Canada, forming the
most conspicuous plant in farmyards,
along roadsides, meadows, pastures and
in orchards. Flowers are matured
throughout the entire season, but chiefly
in the spring and again in the late summer
or early autumn. The plant belongs
to the same family as the sunflower,
daisy, goldenrod and iron weed.</p>
<p>Dandelion has been used medicinally
for many centuries, and the name is derived
from the Latin dens leonis, meaning
lion&rsquo;s tooth, referring to the incised
leaves. Theophrastus described the plant
and lauded it very highly in the treatment
of liver complaints and for freckles.
Later (980-1037 A. D.) Arabian physicians
employed it very extensively, principally
in jaundice and other liver complaints.
During the middle ages the
milky juice of this plant was highly recommended
in the treatment of diseases
of the eye. During the sixteenth century
European physicians found it useful
as a quieting and sleep-producing remedy.</p>
<p>The poor of nearly all countries collect
the young, crisp leaves in the early
spring and prepare therefrom a salad,
resembling lettuce salad. The poor in
large cities visit vacant lots, in which the
plants usually grow abundantly, and collect
the leaves for home consumption, or
fill large, often dirty, sacks, and vend it
among the poor tenement dwellers. This
is certainly a dangerous procedure, as all
manner of dirt and disease germs are
found on the leaves, to say nothing of
dirty hands, utensils and containers of
the collectors. No doubt many a case of
typhoid fever or other germ disease
among the poor could be traced to this
source. In country districts there is little
danger connected with eating Dandelion
leaves, and they really form a good,
palatable salad when properly prepared.</p>
<p>The leaves are also cooked, usually
with leaves of other plants (species of
chenopodium), forming &ldquo;greens,&rdquo; highly
relished by the poor. The American
Indians as well as savages of other countries
eat large quantities of the leaves
raw, more rarely cooked. In Germany
and other European countries the roots
are collected, dried, roasted and used as
a substitute for coffee.</p>
<p>The principal use of this plant has thus
far been medicinal, but its value as a curative
agent has certainly been overrated.
It has been used in dropsy, pulmonary
diseases, in stomach derangements, in
hepatic or liver disorders, in icterus,
blotchy skin and other skin diseases, for
biliary calculi, in hypochondriasis, etc.
It has no marked curative properties in
any disorder. Beyond mildly laxative
<span class="pb" id="Page_236">236</span>
and tonic properties it has no effect whatever.
Using taraxacum preparations for
a considerable length of time causes digestive
disorders, mental excitement, vertigo,
coated tongue and nausea.</p>
<p>In lawns the plant proves a great nuisance,
as it displaces the grass, and it is
difficult to exterminate. The plants
must be dug up, roots and all, carted
away and burned. This should be done
early, before the seeds are sufficiently
mature to germinate. For medicinal use
the roots are gathered in March, July
and November, cleaned, the larger roots
cut longitudinally, dried and packed to
be shipped to points of consumption. The
juice expressed from the fresh roots is
also used.</p>
